# Browser Use Framework

A good boilerplate to build automation flows with `browser-use`.

## Setup

Optional, setup the development environment with `nix`:

```bash
nix-shell
```

Install dependencies with poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

Run the project with:

```bash
poetry shell
# follow the instructions to setup playwright for the first time
python main.py
```
